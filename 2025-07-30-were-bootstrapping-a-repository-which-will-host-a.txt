 Tips for getting started:

 1. Ask Claude to create a new app or clone a repository
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results

> we're bootstrapping a repository which will host an LLM-based agentic EMDR application. a minimal PoC will be created and testing and 
  research will be conducted to validate our initial assumptions and continuously improve the system in a collaborative human/AI workflow, 
  hosted in github. Reason about this and decide upon an approach, document it and consider the gh infrastructure 
  (ci,Workflows,actions,tasks, etc - as well as the repository.
