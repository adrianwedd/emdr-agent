4. **Research Platform** (#13) - Clinical study integration
5. **Internationalization** (#14) - Multi-language support
6. **Performance Optimization** (#15) - Production scalability

## 🛡️ Safety-First Approach

### Clinical Oversight
- Licensed EMDR therapist as clinical advisor
- Safety review required for all therapy features
- Regular clinical validation cycles
- Professional approval gates

### Safety Features (Priority)
- Automatic distress monitoring (SUD ≥ 8 triggers)
- Crisis intervention protocols
- Emergency stop mechanisms
- Professional referral system
- Comprehensive grounding techniques

## 👥 Team Requirements

### Core Team (Minimum)
- **Full-Stack Developer** (TypeScript, React, Node.js)
- **AI/ML Engineer** (LLM integration, prompt engineering)
- **Clinical Advisor** (Licensed EMDR therapist)
- **UX Designer** (Mental health app experience)

### Expanded Team (Ideal)
- DevOps Engineer, QA Engineer, Product Manager, Security Engineer

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Zero safety-critical bugs

### Clinical KPIs
- Session completion rate > 70%
- Safety intervention effectiveness > 90%
- Professional approval rating > 90%
- User satisfaction > 4.5/5

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Stack Confirmation
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + Zustand
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for proven reliability
- **AI**: OpenAI + Anthropic with provider abstraction
- **Testing**: Jest + Vitest + Playwright

### Architecture Patterns
- **Monorepo** for coordinated development
- **Multi-agent system** with message routing
- **Event-driven** safety monitoring
- **Repository pattern** for data access
- **Service layer** abstraction

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### Week 1 Priorities
1. **Database connection** - Initialize Prisma client
2. **Core services** - LLM, Auth, User services
3. **Safety foundation** - Basic trigger detection
4. **Development setup** - CI/CD and workflows

### Getting Started
```bash
# Setup development environment
npm run install:all
cp config/development.env .env
# Configure API keys and database
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev

# Start with Issue #2 - Backend Services
# Or Issue #16 - Development Workflow
```
